    3. Limitation Of Python
    4. Flavours Of Python
    5. Python Versions


    1. father of python/developed by guido van rossum in the year of 1989 and published official 1991 release
    2. stack overflow

    a. python lan is high level language and general purpose language and object oriented language (oops)
        general purpose we can solve any kind of problem.

    1.in c we have to write these many lines fo code.
    
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    /* my first program in C */
    printf("Hello, World! \n");
    
    return 0;
    }
    2. in java program we have to write to print just hello world.
 
    public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
   }

    3. But In python we have less lines of code and like english language 

    Python>   print('hello world')



    
2. Feature of Python
1. simple and easy to learn and write the code
2.freeware and opensource and its comes with libraries or we can 
library is like bundle of modules and module nothing is like a file.
in  a module combination of classes and methods/functions etc.,
        #pip install <package name>
3. python is platform independent .we can run and implement on any platform like linux or mac and windows.
4  PYHTHON is Dynamically typed programming language.
    a = 10.0 
    b = 20

4. python is object oriented programming language 

----> flavours of python 
 1.cpython  is standard python 
 2.jython 
 3.Ancondapython, 
 4.rubypython ,
 5.ironpython


> Limitation Of Python:
    python is not using for mobile based applications.
    python is performance wise upto mark if we compared with java.


versions of python are:
 
python 2.0 like 2.7 python 2.0 is now depricated.
python current version 3.8
