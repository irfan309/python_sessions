Topics:
      -->   Identifiers.
            A name in python program is called identifier
            > a identifier can be a variable name, a module name, or a function/method name, and A class Name.


            ex:
                var1 = 10

                Adil_Name = 'Adil khan'

                Total = 2000

                total = 1000

                TOTAL = 5000

                address = 'hyd'

                City = 'secbad'

There certian rules to define Identifiers:

       > in python $ symbols is not allowed 
        ex:     you can declare like this...
                
                Cash = 200000
        
        > you can not declare with symbol

                ex:  total_ca$h = 1000000

                it will not accecpt throws an error...

1. to define a identifer we have to follow these rules...

    a. alphabets (which are small letters and capital letters)
    b. digits (0-9)
    c. a special symbol which is underscore( _ )

        ex: Adil_Adress = 'somewhere' 

2. Identifier should not statrs with digits...

    it means we can not declare any identifier starts with digit..

    ex: 123_Adil = 1000  (wrong)

> python only allow to declare any identifier with alphabets only...

> if you are going to declare a identifier starts with _ then it consider a private variable...
> if you use __ to declare identifier then it consider as stronge varible or private variable..
    
        ex:   _Adil_Name = 'somename'
            
            its a private variable..

            and  

            __AdilAddress = 'somewhere'

            its also private or strong private identifier...

            __Adil__ = 'its a magica mathods or special methods in python'

            ex: python >  __add__


Practice :
            123Name = 'some'    (wrong)
            total123 = '2000'   (correct)
            python2python = 'something' (correct)
            cash = 1000 (correct)
            ca$h = 2000     (wrong)
            _adil_khan_  = 'some thing' (correct)
            
        NOTE: we can not use reserved words of python in our declaration of identifiers

            
2. Reserved words :
    python by default have some words for specific declaration.
        > previous there 33 keywords in python.
        keywords list below...
        'False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await',
         'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except',
          'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda',
          'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 
          'yield

    we have to observe:
        every keywords in python small letters except
            these 3 key words :

                    True 
                    False
                    None
